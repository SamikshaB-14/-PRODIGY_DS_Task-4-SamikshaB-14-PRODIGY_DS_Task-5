2. **Weather Conditions and Severity:**
   - Visualizes the distribution of accidents based on weather conditions and severity.
   - The top 10 weather conditions contributing to accidents are displayed.

3. **Time of Day and Severity:**
   - Analyzes the distribution of accidents by time of day and severity.
   - A count plot is used to display the results.

4. **Month and Severity:**
   - Examines the distribution of accidents by month and severity.
   - A count plot is utilized for visualization.

5. **Traffic Signal Presence and Severity:**
   - Investigates the distribution of accidents based on the presence of a traffic signal and severity.
   - A count plot is employed for visualization.
